	<p>The design is entirely coherent with the proposal of the site. The visuals are very well done, sound and illustrations work perfectly;</p>
	<p>Easy enough to use, if not that evident, there are instructions on how to use. The main problem for me is that it is not https, and it shows an alert of not being a safe site;</p>
	<p>Fun idea and engaging; easy to share the results with social media and generate further interest in using the website.</p>
