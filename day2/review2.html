	<p>The design is not new but is functional;</p>
	<p>Easy to use, the animation before start drawing provides enough explanation to find out what to do next. It would have been nice to have a more evident way to go back to the studio homepage;</p>
	<p>The drawings are a well-executed, clever, not obvious and engaging idea to involve the visitors of the website. Nice usage of the "canvas" function, and the collection of the clients drawings is a nice idea.</p>
