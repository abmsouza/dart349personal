	<p>The design is discreet enough to leave the main product of the client with most of the emphasis, and yet, it looks good. The typography could have been better designed, in my opinion;</p>
	<p>Interesting choices for the cursor - the little delay between the red dot and the white circle add some playfulness to the navigation; the changing diameter when you position the cursor over a clickable area is intuitive to lead to clicking. I also respect the fact that the audio of the videos doesn't immediately start, but you have to click on play for it to happen - but maybe the correct icon to it would be a volume button and not play since the movies were already playing but with no sound. Would probably have been better to play the queue of the movies instead of having them on autorepeat, but to me, it was minor trouble; </p>
	<p>Good overall creativity and well-used motion design for the transitions.</p>
